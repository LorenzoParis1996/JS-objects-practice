1. Creating Objects

    Task: Create a JavaScript object using various methods. Experiment with using an object literal, a constructor function, and the Object.create() method.
    Focus: Understand the differences between these creation methods and when to use each.

2. Accessing Object Properties

    Task: Access properties of an object using both dot notation and bracket notation.
    Focus: Get comfortable with both methods of accessing properties and understand when each is appropriate.

3. Modifying Object Properties

    Task: Change the value of existing properties in your objects.
    Focus: Practice updating values and ensure you can modify properties correctly.

4. Adding New Properties

    Task: Dynamically add new properties to an existing object.
    Focus: Learn how to expand objects by adding new attributes as needed.

5. Iterating Through Object Properties

    Task: Use loops to iterate over all properties in an object.
    Focus: Understand how to access each property and its value systematically.

6. Checking Property Existence

    Task: Determine whether specific properties exist within an object.
    Focus: Learn how to check for property existence using different methods, such as the in operator and hasOwnProperty().

7. Deleting Properties

    Task: Remove properties from an object.
    Focus: Understand how to effectively delete attributes from objects and recognize the implications of doing so.

8. Object Methods

    Task: Add functions as methods within your objects.
    Focus: Explore how methods can be used to perform actions related to the object's data.

9. Object Composition

    Task: Combine multiple objects into one cohesive object.
    Focus: Practice merging objects and understand how this can be useful for organizing related data.

10. Object Serialization and Deserialization

    Task: Convert objects into JSON strings and then back into JavaScript objects.
    Focus: Learn about the importance of serialization for data storage and transmission, as well as how to revert back to original objects.
